# 🎬 WatchClub

## What is this?

WatchClub is a simple web app that helps you coordinate watching things with friends.
I built this to organize a weekly "movie club" with some friends throughout 2026.

This is not meant to be a Serious Thing, but you're welcome to use it if you like.
It's hosted at https://watchclub.squad.gay. Please don't abuse this.

## How does it work?

### 1. Create a "club".

Give it a name, and choose the schedule (every 3 days, every 2 weeks, once a month, etc.).
The "picks" added by members will be scheduled at this interval, starting on the date you choose.

### 2. Invite your friends.

Share the join link.

### 3. Add picks.

The members of the club can add whatever they want the club to watch. There is no minimum number of picks per member, but there is a maximum set when the club is created.

### 4. Start the club.

Once everyone's picks are added, start the club to generate the randomized watching schedule. The club's members will receive an email with calendar events for each scheduled pick.
